API created as part of the node.js course with express and sequelize

---

## Description
The purpose od this API is to simulate a management of a course plataform, with your teachers, students, enrollments, courses and others using sequelize ORM to manage a sqlite database.

## Learnings
During this course, I learned how to use sequelize ORM, create models, simple and complex queries, use services to decouple database access from controllers, create reusable code snippets, avoiding code rewriting.
I think this ORM is a simple way to manage SQL databases, but it doesn't replace the need to learn SQL.
I also learned the concept of helper functions, how and when to use these functions.


## Comments

Commom JS was used 'cause sequelize v6, works better with commomjs than ES Modules.
